# Connect Four

"Connect Four" is the classic boardgame you remember from childhood! This game was written in JavaScript with HTML and CSS. Open the demo and click to play, or clone the repository to play locally!

The computer's moves are determined by selecting a random player piece on the board, then choosing a random adjacent space to drop the computer's piece.
